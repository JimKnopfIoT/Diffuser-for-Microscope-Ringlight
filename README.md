# Diffuser for Microscope Ringlight
3D-printable Diffuser for Microscope Ringlight (created with Rhino 6)

#### Diffuser

The Diffuser consist of a single part that can be clipped onto the ringlight.

I use a cheap HDMI-Microscope-Camera to examine electronic components or for micro-soldering of very small parts. 
The bright white ringlight is too bright and reflects on the soldering edges or on the PCB surface. 
To make the light shine softer I constructed this 3D printable diffuser. 

There are 11 different Versions for diffuser-brightness 0,1 mm - 1,0 mm and 15 mm. Try out different colors.

#### Ringlight 
* Inner diameter: approx. 61 mm
* Outer diameter: approx. 94 mm

#### Requirements:
* 3D printer 
* Filament of your choice
